# Tic-Tac-Toe Android App

This Android application is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe. It's designed to provide a straightforward and engaging gaming experience on Android devices. Players take turns placing their symbols (either "X" or "O") on a 3x3 grid with the goal of being the first to align three of their symbols vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

## Features

- **Two-Player Mode:** The game supports two players, taking turns on the same device.
- **Winning Combination Highlight:** Upon achieving a winning combination, the app highlights the winning symbols to clearly indicate the victory.
- **Game Reset:** A "New Game" button allows players to quickly reset the board and start a new game once a game concludes, either by win or draw.
- **Intuitive UI:** The user interface is designed for ease of use, with large touch areas for each grid cell and clear indications of whose turn it is.
- **Adaptive Layout:** The layout adjusts to different screen sizes and orientations, ensuring a great experience on a wide range of devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Android Studio:** The primary IDE for Android development, used for designing the UI and coding the game logic.
- **Java:** All game logic and UI interactions are implemented using Java.
